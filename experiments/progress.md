# Experiment Progress Log

This document tracks the setup, experiments, and observations for the RL-based GPU resource management project.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup - MicroK8s

The primary goal of this phase was to establish a stable and functional local Kubernetes environment using MicroK8s, suitable for GPU-accelerated workloads.

### Key Decisions & Rationale:

*   **Initial KubeEdge Attempt & Pivot:**
    *   Initially, KubeEdge was considered for a more "realistic" edge simulation as per `experiments/plan.md` (v1).
    *   Encountered persistent conflicts between EdgeCore and the `kubelet` from a `kind` cluster (used to host CloudCore). EdgeCore requires no other Kubelet on the node.
    *   Troubleshooting included:
        *   Identifying `kind`'s `kubelet` as the source of conflict.
        *   Attempting to make CloudCore (in `kind`) accessible to EdgeCore on the host via `kubectl port-forward`.
        *   Realizing the fundamental incompatibility of running EdgeCore and a `kind` control plane (with its `kubelet`) on the same machine without more complex setups (e.g., VM for EdgeCore).
    *   **Decision:** Abandoned KubeEdge in favor of a direct Kubernetes (initially `kind`, then MicroK8s) setup to simplify the environment and focus on RL agent interaction with the Kubernetes API, which offers similar abstractions for resource management. `experiments/plan.md` was updated accordingly.

*   **Transition from `kind` to MicroK8s:**
    *   **`kind` Setup for GPU:**
        *   Attempted to set up a `kind` cluster (1 control-plane, 1 worker) with GPU support.
        *   Installed NVIDIA GPU Operator via Helm.
        *   Encountered issues with GPU Operator pods (`nvidia-dcgm-exporter`, `gpu-feature-discovery`, `nvidia-container-toolkit-daemonset`) stuck in `Init`.
        *   Diagnosed `FailedCreatePodSandBox` ("no runtime for nvidia") and `driver-validation` failures in `nvidia-container-toolkit-daemonset`.
        *   Suspected incompatibility between a very new beta NVIDIA driver (570.133.07) and GPU Operator v25.3.0.
        *   After a driver change, `kind` cluster creation failed with `exec: "nvidia-container-runtime": executable file not found in $PATH`.
        *   Though `docker run --gpus all ... nvidia-smi` worked, indicating Docker's NVIDIA runtime was functional, `kind` still had issues.
    *   **Decision:** Switched to MicroK8s due to its simpler GPU setup (`microk8s enable nvidia`) and potentially better integration with host NVIDIA drivers. `experiments/plan.md` was updated.

### MicroK8s Setup Steps & Observations:

1.  **Installation:**
    *   Installed MicroK8s via `sudo snap install microk8s --classic`.
    *   Added user to `microk8s` group: `sudo usermod -aG microk8s $USER && newgrp microk8s`.

2.  **Core Addon Enablement:**
    *   Enabled `helm3` and `dns`: `microk8s enable helm3 dns` (dns is usually enabled by default or as a dependency).
    *   Enabled `nvidia` for GPU support: `microk8s enable nvidia`. This was successful and simpler than the `kind` + GPU Operator Helm install. Node became schedulable with GPU resources.
        *   This step simplified the `install.sh` plan, removing the manual GPU Operator Helm installation.

3.  **Storage, Networking, and Monitoring Addon Enablement:**
    *   Command executed: `microk8s enable hostpath-storage ingress metallb:10.64.140.43-10.64.140.49 metrics-server prometheus`
    *   **`hostpath-storage`:** Enabled successfully. Note: Warned as not suitable for production.
    *   **`ingress`:** Enabled successfully.
    *   **`metallb`:**
        *   Enabled with the specified IP range `10.64.140.43-10.64.140.49`.
        *   During enablement, encountered several errors:
            ```
            Error from server (InternalError): error when creating "STDIN": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "ipaddresspoolvalidationwebhook.metallb.io": failed to call webhook: Post "https://webhook-service.metallb-system.svc:443/validate-metallb-io-v1beta1-ipaddresspool?timeout=10s": dial tcp 10.152.183.231:443: connect: connection refused
            ```
            (and similar for `l2advertisementvalidationwebhook.metallb.io`)
        *   Despite these initial webhook errors, MetalLB reported as successfully enabled, and `ipaddresspool.metallb.io/default-addresspool` along with `l2advertisement.metallb.io/default-advertise-all-pools` were created. This suggests the webhooks became available shortly after the initial attempts.
    *   **`metrics-server`:** Enabled successfully.
    *   **`prometheus`:**
        *   Enabled successfully but issued a deprecation warning: `'prometheus' is deprecated and will soon be removed. Please use 'observability' instead.`
        *   The command proceeded to enable the `observability` addon, which includes `kube-prometheus-stack`, `loki`, and `tempo`.
        *   Observability stack reported as enabled (user/pass: admin/prom-operator).

### Current Status (as of 2025-05-13):

*   MicroK8s is installed and running.
*   Essential addons for GPU workloads, storage, networking, and observability are enabled:
    *   `helm3`
    *   `dns`
    *   `nvidia`
    *   `hostpath-storage`
    *   `ingress`
    *   `metallb` (IP range `10.64.140.43-10.64.140.49`)
    *   `metrics-server`
    *   `observability` (replacing the deprecated `prometheus` addon)
*   The system seems ready for deploying the MobileNetV4 workload and starting baseline experiments as outlined in `experiments/plan.md`.

### Decisions for Workload Deployment (as of 2025-05-13):

*   **Project Directory Structure for Experiments:**
    *   `experiments/scripts/`: For MicroK8s deployment YAMLs and related scripts.
    *   `experiments/baseline/`: For baseline experiment code, configurations, and results.
    *   `experiments/rl/`: For RL agent code, training scripts, models, and results.
    *   `experiments/data/`: For image datasets (e.g., Tiny ImageNet validation set).
*   **Image Dataset:** Tentatively **Tiny ImageNet (validation set)**, to be placed in `experiments/data/tiny-imagenet/val/`.
*   **Load Generator:** **Locust** (Python-based, flexible).
*   **MobileNetV4 Serving Method:** **Triton Inference Server** (performance, GPU support, flexibility).
*   **MobileNetV4 Kubernetes Manifest:** To be created at `experiments/scripts/mobilenetv4-triton-deployment.yaml`.

### Next Steps (from `experiments/plan.md`):

1.  **Verify all addon pods are running correctly, especially in `metallb-system` and `observability` namespaces.**
    *   **Status: COMPLETED (2025-05-13)**
    *   `metallb-system` pods (`controller`, `speaker`) are `Running` and `READY 1/1`.
    *   `observability` pods (Alertmanager, Grafana, Prometheus Operator, Kube State Metrics, Node Exporter, Loki, Promtail, Prometheus, Tempo) are all `Running` and `READY`. (Alertmanager had 1 restart but recovered).
2.  Proceed with deploying the MobileNetV4 service.
3.  Deploy the load generator (Locust/k6).
4.  Begin Phase 2: Baseline Evaluation.

## Baseline Results (2025-05-15)

### QoS Metrics (10 users)
- **Average latency**: ~72 ms
- **P95 latency**: ~74 ms
- **P99 latency**: ~81 ms
- **Throughput**: ~13 requests/second
- **Success rate**: 100%

### Model Responsiveness
- Model successfully processes all synthetic inputs
- Consistent output distribution (all predictions favor class 644)
- Stable latency across requests

### GPU Utilization
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080
- **Memory Usage**: ~1.5GB / 10GB VRAM
- **GPU Utilization**: ~43% during inference
- **Configuration**: Using Triton's GPU backend with `instance_group [ { kind: KIND_GPU, count: 1 } ]`

### Challenges
- **Model Accuracy Evaluation**: Unable to properly evaluate model accuracy with Tiny ImageNet due to class mapping issues between Tiny ImageNet (200 classes) and ImageNet (1000 classes)
- **Solution**: Used synthetic data to evaluate model responsiveness instead of true accuracy
- **Dataset**: Tiny ImageNet dataset is available at `/home/guilin/allProjects/ecrl/data/tiny-imagenet/tiny-imagenet-200`

### Next Steps
1. Complete baseline experiments with medium and high loads
2. Design RL agent state and action spaces based on collected metrics
3. Implement reward function balancing resource efficiency and QoS
